Before going into restoration topics, it may be interested to first
understand circumcision's roots in the USA. Although the practice is
one of the oldest and most common surgical procedures, it only gained
popularity in the USA around the 19th century. A number of epidemiological
studies reported in 1855 that 61% of uncircumcised venereal patients had
syphilis compared with 19% of Jewish (circumcised) patients. There was
concern at the time of a relationship between sexuality and disease, leading
to a widespread belief that circumcision was beneficial.

By the end of the 19th century, circumcision was advocated to prevent a range
of conditions. These conditions not only included preventing disease, such as
syphilis, but also to discourage masturbation. Since 1971 the American
Academy of Pediatrics has issued several statements on the practice of
newborn circumcision. The most recent statement, issued in 1999 and
reaffirmed in 2005, states that there is insufficient data to recommend
routine circumcision in newborns.

Circumcision rates in the USA were around 55% in 1938 and increased to around
80% by the 1960s. Today, statistics report that the current rate is close to 58%.
However, the actual rate may be much higher, as circumcision is not routinely
documented on hospital discharge sheets. As a result, the actual rate is thought
to be between to 76â€“92%.

There is a great deal of information available both for and against circumcision.
When a parent is confronted with the decision to either circumcise or not,
it may be simpler to "continue on the tradition" instead of questioning
the practice. As a personal anecdote, when my son was born the doctor during
his newborn check-up asked if we would circumcise him. The doctor reported that
~95% of newborn males in our area are circumcised, and we would not want him
to be different from the others. (We opted to keep him in tact).
