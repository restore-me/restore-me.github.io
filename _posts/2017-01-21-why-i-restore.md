title: "Why I Restore"
date: 2017-01-21

Like many men, when I was born my parents opted to have me circumcised.
I did not have a say in the matter, and would not come to understand
the consequences of the decisions until decades later. After coming
into adulthood and performing research online about circumcision,
I now realize what was taken from me.

Initially I felt angry, not understanding how one could circumcise their
child. Later I felt depressed, believing I would never be able to recover
what was lost. Finally, after much searching I discovered that there were ways
to regrow the foreskin which was removed from birth. It would be imperfect,
as some things would be permanently lost. However, much could be restored!
I then set out to figure out how.

Researching online, there are many techniques. Some require specialized
equipment, others are more simple. Surgery is a possibility, and other
options are less invasive but take dedication for several years.

There are many reasons why one would wish to restore their foreskin.
For me, it is a sense of pride. I started in late 2015, and although not yet
complete, I feel more whole as I continue the journey.

There must be others out there who are unsure how to start, find conflicting
or confusing information online, or are looking for a source of information.
This blog will gather the information that I have learned while undergoing
restoration for myself. The hope is that this blog will help those who are
looking to start their own journey.
