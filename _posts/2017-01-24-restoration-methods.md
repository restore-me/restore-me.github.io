There are a number of methods available for foreskin restoration. Note that
these are not foreskin _restoration_; parts of the foreskin removed
during a circumcision such as the rigid band cannot be restored. Instead,
restoration methods will regenerate the foreskin from what remains.

Foreskin restoration methods all work by providing tension on the remaining
skin. This is thought to stimulate mitosis, and research has shown that
tissue regenerated this way has the attributes of the original tissue.

The process of restoring the foreskin is not quick. The length of time
required will depend on the amount of skin which was removed, the size
of one's penis, and the amount of foreskin desired. With dedication
an optimal restoration may take four or five years. (However, the results
will last a lifetime).

The below image describes the general process.

There are two classes of restoration methods, ones that require medical tape
and ones which are usable without tape. In the beginning, the available options
are limited, as there is not much loose foreskin. One method which works
both at the beginning and throughout the restoration process uses T-Tape.
A T-Tape consists of two layers of medical tape, both stuck together and
attached to a plastic backing. The tape is peeled off of the plastic backing
and applied to the foreskin. After, tension is applied to the tape by attaching
it to a clip and elastic strap and wrapping it around one's waist.

More details on the T-tape method, including how to get started, using T-Tape
as part of a routine, and other information will be in a future post.

Using a T-Tape is all one needs to restore the foreskin. Personally,
the T-Tape method is the only method that I use. However, there are
devices available which can be used after some foreskin has regenerated.
Some require tape and others do not. The basic principle for these methods is
that the newly regenerated foreskin, which may now partially cover the glans,
is attached to a device and the device provides the tension. I'll not list
all of these devices, but instead will give the general idea. An example
of a tape-less device is the Dual Tension Restorer (DTR):

The foreskin is held into place in the nylon bell with a silicone gripper. A
pusher plate is attached to the shaft, and its tension is adjusted with rubber
bands.

An example of a device requiring tape is the Supercanister. The foreskin is taped
to the device. The weight of the device provides some tension, and an elastic
strap can be connected and attached elsewhere to provide additional tension.
